# Amazon Bot

## What is it?
This amazon bot is a PuppeteerJS and Reacdt web-application that allowed you to select items, set price limits, and automatically purchase them once they ater set to your desired price. Despite what most people believe, Amazon prices are exteremely dynamic, changes almost everyday. The bot allows you to capture what you want at the lowest price.

## Why?
At the time, my dad had been looking for a new GPU but seemed all out of luck as everywhere he looked was out of stock. This was also one of the motivators for the build of the bot. It would automatically purchase the indicated item once in stock, as long as set under a specificed price.

## The Technical Sideee!!!
The backend was made with NodeJS, Express, PuppeteerJS, and probably some other technologies I can't remember. It's setup through an Express API to talk with the frontend. Speaking of, the frontend is made with React, CSS (specifically grid was used on this project), and axios.

Thanks for reading.
